Project Description
-----

In two weeks, Team Spartans have created a Facebook clone, imaginatively named Acebook. We had a theme based on the show "Friends". We also had a fluffy pig toy mascot on our desk, which provided us with emotional support.

Features:

 ## Installation Instructions

  - Clone this Repo
  - Run bundle install for all your gem needs
  - Run db:create
  - Run db:migrate

## How to Run Locally:
  - Run Bin/Rails Server

## Instructions for Testing:
  - Run RSpec

## Instructions for Contributions:
  - You are welcome to submit a pull request with any features you'd like to impliment and someone will review it
  - Please strive for a high test coverage.
  - If overwhelmed, hold the fluffy pig. Do not open. It is a waste of time and it doesn't like it.

## Approach
  - We used Agile practices for the first time
  - We randomly selected a leader each day to make any difficult decisions
  - We used a Trello board to keep track of tasks
  - We had stand-ups and retros everyday

## Challenges:
  - Heroku worked fine, but 'Ed', if that is his real name, gave us the challenge halfway through to switch to AWS. Ultimately, we managed to do it, but couldn't find a way to continuously deploy within the provided time frame, as there was a bug that even the tutors had trouble finding. 
  
## How to Deploy:
  - The master branch is automatically deployed on Heroku, providing all RSpec tests pass Travis CI's rigorous testing procedure.
  - This is the link https://acebook-the-spartans.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in
  - Some of our CSS backgrounds don't show up on Heroku. This is something we would fix if we had more time.
